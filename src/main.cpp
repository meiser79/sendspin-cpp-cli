/// @brief sendspin-cli: a headless Sendspin player endpoint
///
/// Boots a SendspinClient in the `player` role, points it at an AudioSink, and pumps
/// client.loop() until a signal arrives. A Sendspin server drives everything else.
///
/// Two connection modes, which the spec makes mutually exclusive: by default the player
/// advertises `_sendspin._tcp` and waits to be dialled, and any -s instead makes it dial
/// out -- to an address, or to a server it discovers over mDNS -- with the advertisement
/// suppressed.
///
/// The same binary is also its own client: `sendspin-cli <subcommand>` talks to a running
/// player over that player's control socket and exits, without opening a device or a port.
