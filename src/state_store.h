/// @file state_store.h
/// @brief What the daemon remembers about itself across restarts
///
/// One flat `key = value` file, written only by the daemon and never meant to be hand-edited --
/// which is what keeps it a separate file from the operator's config (`src/config_file.h`). A
/// daemon that rewrote its own config would destroy the comments and the ordering someone put
/// there; a config the daemon could not write would have nowhere to record a volume.
///
/// The two remembered server keys mean different things and are deliberately not reconciled with
/// each other. `last-server` is the server *id*, which mDNS discovery compares against a browsed
/// instance to break a tie between candidates. `last-server-hash` is the opaque `uint32_t` the
/// library hands us through `SendspinPersistenceProvider`, which it uses to prefer the
/// last-played server among *inbound* connections -- an FNV1 hash produced by
/// `ConnectionManager::fnv1_hash()`, which lives in the library's uninstalled `src/`. So we store
/// what we are given and hand it back, and never compute it: reimplementing a private hash and
/// staying bit-compatible with it across `SENDSPIN_GIT_TAG` bumps is not a thing to depend on.
